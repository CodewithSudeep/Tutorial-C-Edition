5. Write short notes about C editor and C complier with their major features. 
Ans: compiler:-
		compiler is used to convert the high level language into machine
level language. The program written in high level language is known as source
program and the corresponding machine level language program is called as object
program. Compiler read the program at-a-time and searches the error and lists
them. If the program is error free then it is converted into object program. When
program size is large then compiler is preferred. Whereas interpreter read only one
line of the source code and convert it to object code. If it check error, statement by
statement and hence of take more time. 

=>functions
1) Compiler is used to convert one form of program to another
2) A compiler should convert the source program to a target machine code 
   in such a way that the generated target code should be easy to understand

3) Compiler should preserve the meaning of source code
4) Compiler should report errors that occur during compilation process

 C editor:-
             C editor is used to write and edit C code. 
             editor usually refers to source code editors that include 
               many special features for writing and editing code. after writing or editing
