5. Write short notes about C editor and C complier with their major features. 
Ans:
C editor:
 An editor is a specialized wprd processor used to prepare or write source code in a programming lanuage ( eg: C , C++,
java and FORTRAN). we write a computer program with words and symbols that are understandable to human beings in the editor.
you type the program directly into a windows on the screen and save the resulting text as separate file .this is often
referred to as the source code .the custom is that the text of a C program is stored in a file with the extension .c for
C programming language.

C compiler:
you cannot directly execute the source file (code). to run on any computer system ,the source file must be translated into
binary numbers (machine level language) understandable to the computer's central processing unit. the compiler produces 
an object from source file for the target computer/operating system i:e compiler translates the preprocessed source code
into machine language that consists sequences of 0s and 1s.
