The process or methodology of installing DevC++ in windows are as follows:-
1.The first step while we start the installer is to select the language of our choice as shown in the below screenshot.
2.Once you select the appropriate language, you have to agree to the license agreement that pop-ups next.
3.Next, we are asked to select the components that we need to install as a part of the dev-C++ installation.
4.Now the installer prompts the user for the destination folder where the dev-C++ files/libraries etc. are to be copied.
5.Once the installation is over, a “finish” dialog that signals the end of the installation appears. We click finish and then we can launch the dev-C++ IDE.
