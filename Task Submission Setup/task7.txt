7. Write short note about Github and write its essential commands with there major work.
Ans:
	GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers. Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, 
initiated an acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion in June, 2018.Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes 
to that code It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers.

Its essential commands with their major work are:-
1. Git clone
Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical
copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.

2. Git branch
Branches are highly important in the git world. By using branches, several developers are able to work in parallel on the same project simultaneously. We can use the 
git branch command for creating, listing and deleting branches.

3.Git add
When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and won't be included in the next commit (unless we change the configurations).

4.Git push
After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.

5.Git pull
The git pull command is used to get updates from the remote repo. This command is a combination of git fetch and git merge which means that, when we use git 
pull, it gets the updates from remote repository (git fetch) and immediately applies the latest changes in your local (git merge).
