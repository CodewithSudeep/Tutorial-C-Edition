7. Write short note about Github and write its essential commands with there major work.
Ans:GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features.
    GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features,
    such as  basic task management tools for every project.copying a repository from one user’s account to another.
    This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account.
    If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a “pull request” to the original owner. 
    That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.
    => commands and there major work:
      1)git clone<url>:- its is used to copying a github repository to our local computer
      2) git add . :-git add adds your modified files to the queue to be committed later
      3)git commit :- commits the files that have been added and creates a new revision with a log
      4)git push :-   pushes your changes to the remote repository.
      5)git pull :-  fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch
